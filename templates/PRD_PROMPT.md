Write a PRD document called `PRD.md` in this directory based on `idea.md`.

Think about how to implement the feature step-by-step. Break it down into smaller, granular tasks as you need. Follow the `ralph/templates/000-sample.md` as structure guide.

IMPORTANT:
- Set Status to "Not Started"
- Implementation steps in the Progress Summary section MUST have checkboxes: [ ] not [x]
- Acceptance Criteria section items should NOT have checkboxes (just bullet points)
- This is a planning document for future implementation, not a completed task list
- Break down the implementation into SMALL, ATOMIC tasks
- Each task should be completable in one focused session
- Aim for 5-10 steps minimum - avoid combining multiple changes into one step
- Each step should have a clear, testable outcome
